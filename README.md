### Abstract
Machine learning methods have facilitated the extrapolation of estimates of canopy height from optical imagery in locations where direct observations (LiDAR, RADAR) are unavailable, significantly improving our ability to understand forest structure and estimate aboveground biomass at global scales. Quantifying the uncertainty of these predictions, and thus determining credibility of models, is critical for users to select the most useful model for their application. To date, no independent intercomparison and validation of available, wall-to-wall Canopy Height Models (CHMs) has been published. Presented here is a novel, comprehensive, robust, fair, and transparent methodology for conducting a model intercomparison and validation of the existing, publicly available catalogue of CHMs, at the time of writing. The intended purpose of the CAnopy height Model Intercomparison (CAMI) exercise is for it to be repeatedly conducted in phases, and scope expanded, as model developers release new, or improve existing models. The study compares 4 CHMs with globally exhaustive coverage, generated for 2019-2020 (inclusive) leaf-on season using various machine learning methods, across 6 globally-representative, well-established scientific forest plots (FBRM sites) with ALS and GEDI footprint coverage. CHMpot is found to be the most credible model of the ensemble, with high mean prediction accuracy (RMSE=9.30m, MAE=7.36m), low mean bias (ME=0.49m), and strong agreement with CHMpau. When validated against ALS, all models performed to within 40-60% of the observed height for heights within the optimal range, which was found to be 25-40m for best ensemble prediction accuracy.
